# You are provided a csv file (attached). Using python libraries at your disposal, run a loop to extract up to 10 datasets (preferably .xlxs format) based on different criterias (e.g., country, prevalence, etc.). Kindly document your steps as you go through the process.

## we converted array to list for using the list method!!

# ## Section II: VISUALISATION
# a. Using the same dataset, run a loop to generate up to 10 infographics using a suitable python library to visualize trends. The infographics need to be of the same format - i.e., you are required to generate them in a loop. Kindly document your steps as you go through the process.
# 
# b. Write up an article (~500 words) for any one, or a combination of, these infographics.
